{% include index/jumbotron.html %}

An album/series of imperfect/poor image/low-resolution abstractions<br>
based on smartphone screen captures of my best gameplay in the retro jet fighter genre<br>
to celebrate/perpetuate the Neon Noir dystopian sci-fi aesthetic<br>
during the dawn of deep space discoveries, drone warfare, and ESports

captured on mobile "3rd screen" technology<br>
edited on the 2nd<br>
published to the internet as social media content<br>
to encourage reflection in reflexive times<br>
as an introspective aesthetic experience<br>
by a Visual Musician who wants to see additive algorithms outlawed
